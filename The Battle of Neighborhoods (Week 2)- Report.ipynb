What makes it unique is the beautiful mix of nature and city where people who live there as well as visit have so much to explore. For this submission, I would like to focus on San Francisco city\u2019s city parks in order to determine where one would open a dog walking business in the city.\n\nAn in depth study of the parks in various neighborhoods of the city will be done based on the current data found online and if there are current dog walking businesses in those areas. I think it would be an interesting study to understand how far residents currently go to walk their dogs and based on the research, data like how far of an area the business would need to cover to get customers."

Scrape data from available links online with the city park list\n    2. Use the libraries such as geopy to ontain coordinates (latitude, longitude) of the parks\n    3. Use the foursquare API to find all available businesses in those areas and narrow it down to other pet businesses\n    4. Group the pet related businesses into categories\n    5. Explore the competition that directly relates to dogwalking"

As seen in the notebook, there were two dog related businesses in total around all parks. One was the B and B pet store in Sutro District and the other was Yap, a pet store in Aquatic Park. It is very relevant to the research because there is a lot of scope to open a dog walking business in these areas with more focus on the areas near the existing pet stores. I did some further analysis on the common venue categories and frequency of the categories using groupby and frequency to obtain more details.  "

By using these research tools, libraries and Foursquare API, data was analyzed and some interesting facts were observed. I would definitely focus my efforts on a business in these areas surrounding the park. Please review my notebook for the analysis done. "
